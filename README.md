# HateSpeechTrends

In this project, I want to identify hate speech related trends on Reddit. I will fetch real time data from Reddit using their official API and some additional libraries. Identification of hate content is an important problem for the social networks and many political posts on the social networks may have hate speech or harsh content. 

I will be using the US Politics subreddit. The Reddit API returns actual content of the posts along with the metadata associated with the posts. I will focus on detecting hate or racism related key words using pre-defined dictionaries. In other words, for each of the keyword, I will perform a lookup into pre collected collections of hate speech keywords. I will also visualize the trends related to hate speech. For example, the number of hateful posts in the last week and most frequent hate speech related keyword.
