# HateSpeechTrends
In this project, I am going to identify hate speech related trends on Twitter. I will be analzying different twitter datasets in batch processing mode using Apache Spark. Identification of hate content is an important challenge for the social networks and many posts on the social networks may have hate speech or harsh content. 

I will focus on detecting hate or racism related key words using pre-defined dictionaries. In other words, for each tweet, I will perform a lookup into pre collected collections of hate speech keywords. I will also visualize the trends related to hate speech. For example, the number of hateful posts in the last week and most frequent hate speech related keyword.
